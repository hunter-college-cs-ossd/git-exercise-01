  Instructor: Stewart Weiss
  Assignment: Git WorkÙè∞Çflow
    The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize the student with git commands.
    In addition, the student had to learn and understand
    how pushing and pulling works on forked branches, in relation to the original repo.
    The exercise was then concluded with the final C++ code here.
    Commiting this file will provide the student an example of pushing to repos.
